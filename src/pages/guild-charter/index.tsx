							Welcome to our Guild Charter! We, here at Bravado, are a community of Albion players that value <span className="gold">fun</span>, <span className="gold">positive</span> and <span className="gold">supportive</span>, <span className="gold">engaging community</span> as we play a game we all love.
							Do you like to strike down <span className="strikethrough">noobs</span> other players as you <span className="strikethrough">whisper them uninstall directions</span> loot their bodies
							and ride off into the sunset with the taste of sweet, sweet victory coursing through your veins? ‚öîÔ∏è ü©∏ üí∞ Then you are definitely in the right place.

					<div className="charterRow">
						<p>
							I like to think of Bravado as <span className="underline">audacious courage</span>, and that is exactly who we aspire to be as a guild.

					<div className="charterRow">
						<p>
							We are a <span className="underline">Black Zone focused</span> guild who loves to be <span className="gold">scrappy</span>, <span className="gold">take fights</span> at every turn, <span className="gold">gank</span> often, and generally show others our <span className="gold">prowess</span> in battle.
						</p>
					</div>

					<div className="charterRow">
						<p>
							We are absolutely down to gather, take out some world bosses, play the market, and even push for good rankings as a guild.

							However, our focus is on <span className="gold">PVP activities</span> that make the name Bravado <span className="underline">command respect</span> from the players who engage with us on our home turf and on the battlefield.
